## What is SpringGen?

SpringGen is a developer productivity tool that creates fully structured Spring Boot backend projects so you do not waste time on repetitive boilerplate setup.

Instead of spending hours configuring:

* Spring Boot project structure
* Authentication scaffolding
* Docker setup
* Database configuration
* CI/CD pipeline setup
* Deployment configuration

you can generate a working backend project in seconds.

> [!NOTE]
> SpringGen uses a deterministic template/module engine to assemble tested Spring Boot project structures, configurations, and production-ready components.
>
> Generated projects come from maintained templates and predictable configurations — not runtime AI-generated code from prompts.


Think of it as:

> Like a frontend starter generator — but for production-ready Spring Boot backends.

SpringGen is not just a template pack. It is a generator platform with a CLI and web UI that dynamically builds project structures based on selected configuration options.

## How is SpringGen Different?

### vs Spring Initializr

Spring Initializr gives you a project foundation — dependencies, build files, and a basic application entry point. SpringGen starts where Initializr stops:
* Layered architecture with controllers, services, repositories
* DTO patterns and global exception handling
* Security scaffolding (JWT + OAuth2)
* Docker, CI/CD, and AWS deployment configuration

### vs JHipster
JHipster is a full-stack generator — frontend, backend, and ongoing project management through its own ecosystem. Powerful if you want everything generated and maintained for you.

SpringGen is backend-only and disappears after generation. No frontend opinions, no generator dependencies left in your project, no new ecosystem to learn. Just clean, standard Spring Boot code you recognize and own from day one.

> SpringGen sits between Initializr and JHipster — more structure than one, less ecosystem than the other.

## Why Developers Use SpringGen

Setting up a new Spring Boot project the right way takes several hours —
project structure, security config, Docker, CI/CD pipeline,
deployment scripts. SpringGen does it in 30 seconds.
The same structure an experienced Java developer would write,
not a tutorial skeleton. Just open your IDE and start building your business logic.

Deploy anytime with a ready-to-use script.

Generated:

```text
scripts/deploy-ec2.sh
```

## AWS EC2 Deployment Automation

![SpringGen EC2 Deployment](examples/screenshots/pro-ec2-deployment-flow.png)

SpringGen Pro supports two deployment workflows:

### Automated Deployment

```text
GitHub Secrets
   ↓
Git Push
   ↓
GitHub Actions
   ↓
EC2
   ↓
Docker Application Running
```

Best for production workflows.


### Manual Deployment

Use the generated deploy script on EC2

```bash
# 1. One-time setup
nano .env.prod

# 2. Deploy anytime
git pull origin main
./scripts/deploy-ec2.sh
```

Best for manual releases, testing, and full control over deployments.
